# Rebar Architecture

## 1. System Overview

Rebar is a distributed actor runtime for Rust, directly inspired by Erlang/OTP's BEAM virtual machine. It brings the battle-tested process model of BEAM -- lightweight processes, message passing, supervision trees, and transparent distribution -- into the Rust ecosystem, combining Erlang's fault-tolerance philosophy with Rust's memory safety and zero-cost abstractions.

The project is organized into a layered crate architecture that enforces clean separation of concerns. At the foundation, `rebar-core` provides the local process runtime with zero networking dependencies: process spawning, mailbox-based message passing, a concurrent process table, and OTP-style supervisor trees. Built on top of that, `rebar-cluster` adds all distribution capabilities: a binary wire protocol, TCP transport, SWIM-based failure detection and membership gossip, a CRDT-based global name registry, and connection management with automatic reconnection. The `rebar` facade crate re-exports everything from both core and cluster through a single unified interface, while `rebar-ffi` exposes a C-ABI layer that enables embedding the runtime in Go, Python, TypeScript, and any other language with C FFI support.

This layering means applications that only need local concurrency can depend on `rebar-core` alone, paying zero cost for networking code they do not use. When distribution is needed, `rebar-cluster` adds it without requiring any changes to existing process logic -- a process sends a message to a `ProcessId` regardless of whether the target is local or remote.

## 3. Process Model

Each process in Rebar is an independent asynchronous task running on the Tokio runtime. Processes are identified by a globally unique `ProcessId` consisting of a `(node_id: u64, local_id: u64)` pair, displayed as `<node_id.local_id>`. The `node_id` identifies which cluster node owns the process, while `local_id` is a monotonically incrementing counter allocated via `AtomicU64::fetch_add`.

### Process Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SPAWN["Runtime::spawn()"] --> ALLOC["Allocate PID<br>AtomicU64::fetch_add"]
    ALLOC --> MBOX["Create Mailbox<br>tokio mpsc channel<br>bounded or unbounded"]
    MBOX --> HANDLE["Create ProcessHandle<br>wraps MailboxTx"]
    HANDLE --> INSERT["Insert into ProcessTable<br>DashMap&lt;ProcessId, ProcessHandle&gt;"]
    INSERT --> TASK["Start tokio::spawn<br>outer task wraps inner task"]
    TASK --> INNER["Inner tokio::spawn<br>runs handler(ProcessContext)"]
    INNER --> HANDLER["Handler executes<br>ctx.recv(), ctx.send(),<br>ctx.self_pid()"]

    HANDLER --> NORMAL["Return normally"]
    HANDLER --> PANIC["Panic!"]

    NORMAL --> CLEANUP["Outer task awaits inner<br>Always runs cleanup"]
    PANIC --> CATCH["tokio catches panic<br>via JoinHandle"]
    CATCH --> CLEANUP

    CLEANUP --> REMOVE["Remove from ProcessTable<br>table.remove(&pid)"]

    style PANIC fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style CATCH fill:#f39c12,color:#fff
    style REMOVE fill:#95a5a6,color:#fff
```

**Panic isolation** is a core design principle. Each process handler runs inside a nested `tokio::spawn` -- the outer task spawns an inner task containing the actual handler, then awaits the inner task's `JoinHandle`. If the handler panics, Tokio catches the panic and returns a `JoinError` rather than propagating it. The outer task always executes cleanup (removing the process from the table) regardless of whether the inner task completed normally or panicked. This means a single misbehaving process can never crash the runtime or affect other processes.

**ProcessContext** is the handle each process receives, providing three capabilities:
- `self_pid()` -- returns the process's own `ProcessId`
- `recv()` / `recv_timeout(duration)` -- receives messages from the mailbox
- `send(dest, payload)` -- sends a message to another process by PID

## 4. Message Flow

Messages in Rebar are structs containing a sender `ProcessId`, a `rmpv::Value` payload (MessagePack dynamic value), and a millisecond-precision timestamp. The use of `rmpv::Value` allows messages to carry arbitrary structured data -- strings, integers, maps, arrays, binary blobs -- without requiring a fixed schema.

### Local Messaging

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sender as Sender Process
    participant Table as ProcessTable<br>(DashMap)
    participant TX as MailboxTx<br>(mpsc sender)
    participant RX as MailboxRx<br>(mpsc receiver)
    participant Handler as Receiver Process

    Sender->>Table: table.send(dest_pid, msg)
    Table->>Table: processes.get(&pid)
    alt PID found
        Table->>TX: handle.send(msg)
        TX->>RX: channel delivery<br>(unbounded: always succeeds,<br>bounded: try_send semantics)
        RX->>Handler: ctx.recv().await
    else PID not found
        Table-->>Sender: Err(SendError::ProcessDead)
    end
```

### Remote Messaging

When a process sends to a PID on a different node, the `MessageRouter` trait intercepts the call and routes it over the network. The `DistributedRouter` (from `rebar-cluster`) implements this trait: it delivers locally when `to.node_id() == self.node_id`, otherwise encodes the message as a `Frame` and sends a `RouterCommand::Send` to the transport layer via an mpsc channel.

On the receiving node, `deliver_inbound_frame()` extracts addressing from the frame header and delivers the payload to the target process's mailbox.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sender as Sender Process
    participant Router as DistributedRouter
    participant Chan as RouterCommand Channel
    participant CM as ConnectionManager
    participant Wire as TCP / QUIC
    participant RCM as Remote ConnectionManager
    participant Deliver as deliver_inbound_frame()
    participant RTable as Remote ProcessTable

    Sender->>Router: ctx.send(remote_pid, payload)
    Router->>Router: to.node_id() != self.node_id
    Router->>Chan: RouterCommand::Send [node_id, Frame]
    Chan->>CM: process_outbound()
    CM->>Wire: connection.send(frame)
    Wire->>RCM: connection.recv()
    RCM->>Deliver: deliver_inbound_frame(table, frame)
    Deliver->>RTable: table.send(local_pid, msg)
    RTable->>RTable: Local delivery via ProcessHandle
```

Key types:
- **`MessageRouter`** trait (rebar-core) — `route(from, to, payload) -> Result<(), SendError>`
- **`LocalRouter`** — default, wraps ProcessTable for single-node use
- **`DistributedRouter`** — local + remote routing via RouterCommand channel
- **`DistributedRuntime`** (rebar facade) — wires core Runtime with cluster ConnectionManager

See [Distribution Layer Internals](internals/distribution-layer.md) for the full deep dive.

## 5. Supervisor Trees

Rebar implements OTP-style supervision trees. A supervisor manages a set of child processes, monitoring them and applying a restart strategy when they fail. Supervisors themselves can be children of other supervisors, forming hierarchical fault-tolerance trees.

### Supervisor with Children

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SUP["Supervisor<br>strategy: OneForOne<br>max_restarts: 3<br>max_seconds: 5"]
    A["Child A<br>Permanent"]
    B["Child B<br>Permanent"]
    C["Child C<br>Transient"]

    SUP --> A
    SUP --> B
    SUP --> C
```

### Restart Strategies

When child B crashes, the supervisor's restart strategy determines which children are restarted:

**OneForOne** -- Only the crashed child restarts:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph before["Before Crash"]
        A1["A: running"]
        B1["B: running"]
        C1["C: running"]
    end

    subgraph crash["B Crashes"]
        A2["A: running"]
        B2["B: CRASHED"]
        C2["C: running"]
    end

    subgraph after["After Restart"]
        A3["A: running"]
        B3["B: restarted"]
        C3["C: running"]
    end

    before --> crash --> after

    style B2 fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style B3 fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

**OneForAll** -- All children restart:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph before["Before Crash"]
        A1["A: running"]
        B1["B: running"]
        C1["C: running"]
    end

    subgraph crash["B Crashes"]
        A2["A: stopped"]
        B2["B: CRASHED"]
        C2["C: stopped"]
    end

    subgraph after["After Restart"]
        A3["A: restarted"]
        B3["B: restarted"]
        C3["C: restarted"]
    end

    before --> crash --> after

    style A2 fill:#f39c12,color:#fff
    style B2 fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style C2 fill:#f39c12,color:#fff
    style A3 fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style B3 fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style C3 fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

**RestForOne** -- The crashed child and all children started after it restart:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph before["Before Crash"]
        A1["A: running"]
        B1["B: running"]
        C1["C: running"]
    end

    subgraph crash["B Crashes"]
        A2["A: running"]
        B2["B: CRASHED"]
        C2["C: stopped"]
    end

    subgraph after["After Restart"]
        A3["A: running"]
        B3["B: restarted"]
        C3["C: restarted"]
    end

    before --> crash --> after

    style B2 fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style C2 fill:#f39c12,color:#fff
    style B3 fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style C3 fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

### Restart Limiting

The supervisor tracks restart timestamps in a `VecDeque<Instant>` sliding window. Each time a child is restarted, the current `Instant` is pushed onto the deque. Before restarting, the supervisor checks whether the number of restarts within the last `max_seconds` (default: 5) exceeds `max_restarts` (default: 3). If the limit is exceeded, the supervisor itself shuts down -- this prevents infinite restart loops from consuming resources and propagates the failure up the supervision tree.

**Restart types** determine whether a child should be restarted based on how it exited:
- **Permanent** -- always restart, regardless of exit reason
- **Transient** -- restart only on abnormal exit (panics, errors); normal exits are not restarted
- **Temporary** -- never restart, regardless of exit reason

**Shutdown strategies** control how a child is terminated during supervisor shutdown or restart-all scenarios:
- **Timeout(duration)** -- send a shutdown signal and wait up to `duration` for graceful exit (default: 5s)
- **BrutalKill** -- terminate the child immediately without waiting

## 6. SWIM Protocol

Rebar uses the SWIM (Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style process group Membership) protocol for cluster membership and failure detection. The implementation lives in the `rebar-cluster::swim` module.

### Node State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Alive : Node joins cluster

    Alive --> Suspect : Direct probe fails (no ACK)
    Suspect --> Alive : ACK received (direct or indirect)
    Suspect --> Dead : suspect_timeout expires (5s)
    Dead --> Removed : dead_removal_delay expires (30s)

    Removed --> [*]
```

The `Member` struct also carries an optional `cert_hash: Option<[u8; 32]>` field — the SHA-256 fingerprint of the node's TLS certificate. When present, this enables automatic QUIC transport connections: a node receiving an `Alive` gossip with a `cert_hash` can connect to the advertised address and verify the certificate fingerprint without a CA.

### Protocol Mechanics

The SWIM protocol operates on a configurable tick cycle (default: 1 second `protocol_period`):

1. **Direct Probe**: Each tick, the `FailureDetector` selects a random alive or suspect member (excluding self) and sends a direct ping. If the target responds with an ACK, it remains (or returns to) Alive state.

2. **Indirect Probes**: If the direct probe fails (no ACK within the tick), the node is marked Suspect. The protocol then selects `indirect_probe_count` (default: 3) random alive members and asks them to probe the suspect node on its behalf. If any indirect probe receives an ACK, the suspect is cleared.

3. **Suspect Timeout**: A suspected node has `suspect_timeout` (default: 5 seconds) to prove it is alive. If no ACK arrives (directly or via indirect probes) within this window, the node is declared Dead.

4. **Dead Removal**: Dead nodes are kept in the membership list for `dead_removal_delay` (default: 30 seconds) to allow gossip to propagate the death notification. After the delay, they are permanently removed.

5. **Incarnation Numbers**: Each member maintains an `incarnation` counter. When a node is suspected, it can refute the suspicion by incrementing its incarnation number and broadcasting an Alive update with the higher incarnation. Stale suspicions (with lower incarnation than the node's current incarnation) are ignored.

6. **Gossip Piggybacking**: Membership state changes (Alive, Suspect, Dead, Leave) are queued in a `GossipQueue` and piggybacked on protocol messages, up to `max_gossip_per_tick` (default: 8) updates per tick. This provides epidemic-style dissemination of membership information without dedicated gossip rounds.

## 7. Wire Protocol

The wire protocol uses a fixed 18-byte header followed by variable-length MessagePack-encoded header and payload sections.

### Frame Layout

```
Offset  Size  Field
------  ----  -----
0       1     version (0x01)
1       1     msg_type (MsgType as u8)
2       8     request_id (u64 big-endian)
10      4     header_len (u32 big-endian)
14      4     payload_len (u32 big-endian)
18      N     header (MessagePack encoded)
18+N    M     payload (MessagePack encoded)
```

Total frame size: `18 + header_len + payload_len` bytes.

### Message Types

| Hex    | Variant          | Description                                          |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x01` | Send             | Deliver a message to a remote process                |
| `0x02` | Monitor          | Request monitoring of a remote process               |
| `0x03` | Demonitor        | Cancel a previously established monitor              |
| `0x04` | Link             | Establish a bidirectional link between processes      |
| `0x05` | Unlink           | Remove a bidirectional link                          |
| `0x06` | Exit             | Signal a process exit to linked/monitoring processes  |
| `0x07` | ProcessDown      | Notification that a monitored process has terminated  |
| `0x08` | NameLookup       | Query the global registry for a named process        |
| `0x09` | NameRegister     | Register a name in the global registry               |
| `0x0A` | NameUnregister   | Remove a name from the global registry               |
| `0x0B` | Heartbeat        | Periodic liveness check between connected nodes      |
| `0x0C` | HeartbeatAck     | Response to a Heartbeat                              |
| `0x0D` | NodeInfo         | Exchange node metadata during connection setup       |

Both the `header` and `payload` fields use `rmpv::Value` (MessagePack dynamic value), allowing flexible structured data without a rigid schema. The header typically carries routing metadata (source/destination PIDs, monitor refs), while the payload carries application data.

## 8. Global Registry (CRDT)

The global name registry uses an OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set) CRDT to provide eventually-consistent process name registration across all nodes in the cluster. Conflict resolution uses Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) semantics.

### Registry Operations

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph register["Register"]
        R1["Create RegistryEntry"] --> R2["Generate UUID v4 tag"]
        R2 --> R3["Record timestamp +<br>node_id"]
        R3 --> R4["Add to entries map"]
        R4 --> R5["Emit Add delta<br>for replication"]
    end

    subgraph lookup["Lookup"]
        L1["Collect all entries<br>for name"] --> L2["Pick highest timestamp"]
        L2 --> L3{"Timestamp tie?"}
        L3 -->|Yes| L4["Highest node_id wins<br>(deterministic tiebreak)"]
        L3 -->|No| L5["Return winner"]
        L4 --> L5
    end

    subgraph unregister["Unregister"]
        U1["Remove all entries<br>for name"] --> U2["Add each tag to<br>tombstone set"]
        U2 --> U3["Emit Remove deltas<br>(one per tag)"]
    end

    subgraph merge["Merge Remote Delta"]
        M1{"Delta type?"} -->|Add| M2{"Tag in<br>tombstones?"}
        M2 -->|Yes| M3["Reject:<br>prevents resurrection"]
        M2 -->|No| M4{"Tag already<br>present?"}
        M4 -->|Yes| M5["Skip:<br>idempotent"]
        M4 -->|No| M6["Add entry to map"]
        M1 -->|Remove| M7["Add tag to tombstones"]
        M7 --> M8["Remove entry from map"]
    end

    subgraph convergence["Convergence"]
        C1["Node A applies deltas"] --> C3["Same deltas +<br>commutative merge"]
        C2["Node B applies deltas"] --> C3
        C3 --> C4["Identical state on<br>all nodes"]
    end
```

### Convergence Properties

The OR-Set CRDT guarantees that when all deltas have been exchanged and applied, every node in the cluster will have identical registry state. Key properties:

- **Add-wins semantics**: A new registration with a fresh UUID tag is always accepted (unless that specific tag has been tombstoned).
- **Tombstone permanence**: Once a UUID tag is tombstoned, it can never be re-added. This prevents the "resurrection" problem where concurrent add and remove operations could cause a removed entry to reappear.
- **Idempotent merges**: Applying the same Add delta multiple times has no effect beyond the first application.
- **Commutativity**: Deltas can be applied in any order and produce the same result.

## 9. Connection Management

The `ConnectionManager` handles the lifecycle of connections to remote nodes, integrating with SWIM discovery and providing automatic reconnection with exponential backoff.

### Connection Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SWIM as SWIM Protocol
    participant CM as ConnectionManager
    participant TC as TransportConnector
    participant Remote as Remote Node

    Note over SWIM: Node discovered via gossip
    SWIM->>CM: on_node_discovered(node_id, addr)
    CM->>CM: Check: already connected?

        TC->>Remote: TCP handshake
        Remote-->>TC: Connected
        TC-->>CM: Box[dyn TransportConnection]
        CM->>CM: Store connection +<br>clear reconnect attempts
    end

    Note over CM: Normal operation: routing frames
    CM->>Remote: route(node_id, frame)

    Note over CM,Remote: Connection lost

    CM->>CM: on_connection_lost(node_id)
    CM->>CM: Emit NodeDown event
    CM->>CM: Emit ReconnectTriggered event

    Note over CM: Reconnection with exponential backoff
    loop Backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s cap
        CM->>TC: attempt_reconnect(node_id)
        alt Success
            TC->>Remote: TCP handshake
            Remote-->>TC: Connected
            TC-->>CM: Connection restored
            CM->>CM: Clear reconnect attempts
        else Failure
            TC-->>CM: Error
            CM->>CM: Increment attempt counter
            Note over CM: Wait backoff_delay<br>min(base * 2^attempt, max)
        end
    end
```

### Reconnection Policy

The `ReconnectPolicy` uses exponential backoff with the formula: `delay = min(base_delay * 2^attempt, max_delay)`.

| Attempt | Delay (default config) |
|---------|----------------------|
| 0       | 1s                   |
| 1       | 2s                   |
| 2       | 4s                   |
| 3       | 8s                   |
| 4       | 16s                  |
| 5+      | 30s (capped)         |

The `TransportConnector` trait abstracts the transport implementation, allowing the `ConnectionManager` to work with TCP, QUIC, or mock transports interchangeably.

### QUIC Transport

Rebar includes a QUIC transport implementation (`rebar-cluster::transport::quic`) built on [quinn](https://docs.rs/quinn) 0.11. Key design decisions:

- **Stream-per-frame model.** Each `send()` opens a new unidirectional QUIC stream, writes a 4-byte big-endian length prefix followed by the encoded frame, then finishes the stream. Each `recv()` accepts a unidirectional stream and reads the length-prefixed frame. This avoids head-of-line blocking between independent messages.
- **Self-signed certificates.** `generate_self_signed_cert()` uses [rcgen](https://docs.rs/rcgen) to produce a DER certificate, PKCS8 private key, and SHA-256 fingerprint (`CertHash = [u8; 32]`).
- **Fingerprint verification.** `FingerprintVerifier` implements `rustls::client::danger::ServerCertVerifier` to verify the remote certificate's SHA-256 hash matches the expected value. No CA trust chain is needed.
- **SWIM integration.** The `cert_hash` field on `Member` and `GossipUpdate::Alive` allows nodes to exchange certificate fingerprints via gossip, enabling automatic QUIC connection establishment.

See [QUIC Transport Internals](internals/quic-transport.md) for implementation details.

### Graceful Node Drain

The drain protocol (`rebar-cluster::drain`) provides orderly node shutdown in three phases:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Phase1_Announce
    Phase1_Announce --> Phase2_Drain : gossip Leave sent, names removed
    Phase2_Drain --> Phase3_Shutdown : outbound channel empty or timeout
    Phase3_Shutdown --> [*] : connections closed
```

| Phase | Action | Timeout (default) |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 1. Announce | Broadcast `GossipUpdate::Leave`, unregister all names from registry | 5s |
| 2. Drain Outbound | Process remaining `RouterCommand`s from channel | 30s |
| 3. Shutdown | Close all connections via `ConnectionManager::drain_connections()` | 10s |

`DrainResult` provides observability: `processes_stopped`, `messages_drained`, `phase_durations`, and `timed_out`.

See [Node Drain Internals](internals/node-drain.md) for the full protocol specification.

## 10. FFI Layer

The `rebar-ffi` crate provides a C-ABI interface that enables embedding the Rebar runtime in any language with C FFI support. It exposes opaque handle types and a set of `extern "C"` functions following Rust's `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` convention.

### FFI Architecture

All pointer-accepting functions perform null checks and return `REBAR_ERR_NULL_PTR` for null arguments. Passing null to `_free` functions is a safe no-op, following the convention of C's `free()`.
